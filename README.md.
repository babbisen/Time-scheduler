# Time Scheduler

Simple Node.js server with a static front-end for coordinating working time for four fixed people using shared password access.

## Running locally

1. Install Node.js (v18+).
2. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Default shared password is `letmein`. Override with `APP_PASSWORD`.
- Timezone calculations assume Europe/Brussels.
- Data is stored in memory; restarting the server clears blocks and history.
